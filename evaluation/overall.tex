\subsection{Overall Evaluation}
  As a group we believe that the combination of a clean and intuitive user interface combined with the array of empowering new features has created an encapsulating user profile oriented experience that establishes, encourages and supports the relationship between students and companies.

  The only aspect that we feel could have been incorporated further to enhance the overall design process would have been to increase user testing however we have made continuous use of the feedback from our supervisors, which gave us points of improvements for functionality and interface design.
  
  We believe that the most significant achievement is the fact that the project will inevitably enhance student and company relations throughout all stages of the Corporate Partnership Programme.
