\subsection{Performance}
The performance in terms of the speed of page loads and responsiveness of the user interface is enhanced significantly via the use of Backbone. This reduces the number of server calls and increases client side processing to provide an instantaneous response to user interactions, creating a single page application type interface that supports the user experience and interface. We used New Relic in order to measure performance of the system in terms of user, application and server response times. It provides measures of page load times and can also provide user monitoring to give insight into how user interaction can be improved, for example by identifying poor performance patterns.
One of the main factors influencing the performance of the system is error handling. If the system errors and breaks then this has a significant impact on the user experience, usability and performance. We have extensively tested the system using ... <<<<testing>>> ... and applied user acceptance testing in order to extensively test all parts of the system, and scenarios, to ensure that they perform as expected and to reduce the frequency of system errors to a minimum.
Through the extensive testing, moitoring and the use of Backbone we have developed a fast and robust system thats high performance will support the slick user experience.
