\subsection{Usability}
The user experience and interface are some of the most important factors of our system. The user interface is designed to be as consistent and clean as possible, this was achieved with the help of twitter bootstrap to style elements of the interface.

We continuously considered the user experience throughout development. The combination of rapid interface responsiveness (achieved via the use of Backbone) with an intuitive user interface, makes using the system effortless. For example when a student edits their profile, they can quickly make changes to their key information inline, simply by clicking on what they want to change. The simple yet empowering user experience is key to encouraging extended use of the system and provides a professional impression. Overall we are extremely pleased with the usability of the system and feel that it provides an encapsulating and intuitive experience that the users will enjoy.
