\subsubsection{Evaluating Deliverables}
  The most significant outcome of the system lies in the overall improvement in finding, establishing and encouraging the relationship between students and companies. The system will make it easier for students and companies to get connected and makes the communication and application process more efficient.

\paragraph{Finding Information:}
  The use of Tags in the system provide an efficient way to link up different aspects of the system. Filters are also used to enable the user to quickly locate the information they require, filters can be applied as a text search over a given field or even in some cases enable the use of tags to show results with matching tags. This is particularly useful when companies are searching for students as they can search for students with specific skills, interests or by year group according to the tags that the student has added in their profile. Students can also search through placements and events using tags to suggest placements and events that match their tags. This will provide a more focused result when searching for information and ultimately will encourage increased connections as a result of the improved process of finding exactly what the user is looking for.

\paragraph{Communication:} 
  The system provides an integrated email facility that will Increase connection and enable more targeted emails via the use of tags, this reduces the amount of irrelevant information provided to students, enabling them to find the most relevant information to them and to sustain communications with companies.

\paragraph{Experience:}
  A dashboard where students can collate all their information, including their CV and other documents as well as key information, skills, interests, a bio and even a profile picture. This not only enhances the user experience for students but it also makes it easier for students to tailor their profile and be aware of exactly how the profile is viewed by the company. Having student profiles in this way also makes it easier and more efficient for companies to search for students and provides a more personal and professional environment than just a list of CVs and interests. The top three Events and Placements are displayed on the student profile, enabling students to remain in constant touch with the latest event and placement updates. This further enhances the connectivity between students and companies and makes it easier for student to find relevant information.

\paragraph{Companies:}
  One of the main improvements from the perspective of companies using the system is in searching for students. Previously companies would simply have to laboriously work their way through a list of imperial student cvs until they by chance found a student that they where looking for. In the new system companies can filter students by their skills, interests and year group and can quickly browse through student profiles that match the required criteria. They have the most important information clearly and consistently presented and can instantly access additional information such as cvs and other documentation. Once they have found a student that matches what they are looking for, they can contact the student at the touch of a button, contacting them via the integrated email system.
  Companies have a similar dashboard type profile that students have, enabling them to fill in key information, upload a company logo and create placements and events. This speeds the process and proves a more professional appearance of the program from the companies perspective, the company dashboard even provides analytical information such as the number of students that have viewed the page in the form of a line graph. 

\paragraph{Administration:}
  Due to the profile based system, the process of editing and updating company information, has now been delegated to the companies, this reduces the burden of the administration having to deal with all company information to each company updating their own information. This also increases the speed of the process because a company can instantly change their information at any time and send all that remains is for the changes to be approved by the administration.
  Creating and updating Placements and Events is also delegated out to individual companies which again disperses the amount of processing required by the administration, so that they only need to approve newly requested and pending changes to events and placements.
  Previously there was no way of telling how many students had even signed up to placements through the CPP program. The new system has a suite of analytical information available to the administration, this provides a breakdown key numerical summaries that are of interest to the administration for example the number of students that have viewed company profile pages (and even which students). This continued statistical monitoration will provide insight into the success or failure over certain years, enabling the CPP system to be fine tuned on a more factual grounding.
