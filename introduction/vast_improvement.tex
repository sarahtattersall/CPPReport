%TODO: THIS IS SUMMARY OF WHAT WEVE ACHEIVED DOES IT WORK?
\subsection{Vast Improvement}
We feel that CPP 2.0: Connected, gives students a far more personal feel to looking for a job and advertising their abilities than the current system. It also gives them a fairer chance of being found by a company.

As students ourselves, we know that we often don't read the emails that are currently sent via the Corporate Partnership Program for reasons such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We receive far too many emails from CPP, some of which are irrelevant which puts us off
  \item CPP emails can get lost amist the other emails we receive from the college
  \item The emails do not stand out in our inbox and can sometimes be glanced over
  \item Often when we receive an email we are busy at the time and do not fully register that it might be something of importance.
\end{itemize} 

We can combatted most of these problems by the addition of events and placements being advertised on the site itself, which means students will rarely receive emails about events or placements. Instead when they log on they can browse through the entire lists at a time when they wish to know about them, rather than when very busy and not in the frame of mind, and decide whether to attend/apply or not.

Furthermore, for the emails that still get sent out students are allowed to express desires in emails they do not wish to receive, such as female only information, to help make the Coroporate Partnership Program a more personal experience and ensure that content remains relevant. 

Finally we believe our system will ease the lives of the current Corporate Partnership maintainers, they no longer have to forward on emails or translate paper events/placement slips into event emails. They can rely on CPP 2.0 to do this for them and just approve the entire process.
