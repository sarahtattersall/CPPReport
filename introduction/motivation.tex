\subsection{Motivation}
  There is a clear motivation for this project since the system is very out dated and is barely known about by students in the department.
  At current it does not freely allow a student to express their interests and skills and as such companies have no way of refining the list of students by their skills before having to look at students individual CV's. This means that companies must go through every student listed in the database whilst searching for one with a particular skill set. For example a web development company may only wish to recruit summer interns who have experience with Ruby on Rails. On the current system they must download every single students CV in turn to ascertain if a student would be suited to the role. This is time consuming, frustrating, and realistically is unlikely to happen.
  This can severly disadvantage students whose CV's appear at the bottom of the list and unfortunately students have
  no way of making themselves better found.

  The current system has other flaws, for example once it's been set up there is no way for administrators to tell which corporate partners are using the system and how many students are being contacted. What goes on with the system is really a black hole to the Department of Computing Industrial Liaison Officers. 

  Furthermore the current system does not deal with events and placements. When companies wish to send out information regarding an event or placement they have to fill in forms or send an email to our supervisors which is then typed up and translated into an email for students which is a mundane and time consuming. Some of these emails can be irrelevant for students (for example if an event is for females only it will still be sent to the entire department) and is often a source of much complaint. 
  Both of these issues could be avoided if the CPP automated and advertised events and placements.

  Finally other departments have expressed an interest in this system, but it is not deemed up to date enough to pass on to another department which spurred the interest for our project.
