\subsection{Introducing CPP 2.0: Connected}
CPP 2.0: Connected is a remake of this system that aims to address the crucial issues discussed above and extend the range of abilities that companies and students are offered.

Students are given their own profile to maintain which very quickly shows their skills and interests off to a company before they even have to download a CV. Students are also given the option to add their CV, resume, profile picture, and any other releavnt documents or information about themselves they see fit.

When searching for a student a company administrators' life is made so much easier by being able filter students via their listed skills in order to reduce the number of irrelevant students they have to view. 

Our system also addresses some additional needs of the department that are currently not catered for by the current system. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Emails students receive will be more relevant, based on opt-out settings.
  \item Events and Placements can be advertised by companies and the department on CPP 2.0
\end{itemize}
