\subsection{Introducing CPP 2.0: Connected}
CPP 2.0: Connected is a complete remake of the origional system that aims to address the crucial issues discussed above and extend the range of abilities that companies and students are offered.

The key objectives of CPP 2.0 are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Give students their own profile} which will very quickly show of their skills set and interests. They must also be able to upload important documents.
  \item \textbf{Better search facilities for companies} which will allow companies to more easily find students.
  \item \textbf{Reduce the number of irrelevant emails students are receiving} partly through the creation of events and placements and partly due to email filtering.
  \item \textbf{Reduce the current CPP administrators work load} by allowing companies to advertise events and placements and send emails which can later be approved by the admins.
  \item \textbf{Create a system that is available to other departments} by not tying ourselves down with too many department specific features.
\end{itemize}
