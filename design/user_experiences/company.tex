\subsubsection{Company}
Meanwhile companies can also access the site to gain access to students. For example a recruiter from Netcraft, Sally, wishes to sign up in order to find talented students for placements.
  \paragraph{Sign up:}
    If Netcraft had not yet registered as a company, then the Sally must sign up on Netcrafts behalf with a clear and consise sign up page.

    \caption{Company sign up page}
    \end{figure}

    Since Netcraft already exists then Sally must request that another admininistrator adds her by signing in and clicking on the new administrator button.

    Once signed in Sally is relocated to her dashboard, which has the same useful tool tips and extra features as the student page.

  \paragraph{Contacts:}
    Sally decides that she wishes to be contacted by students regarding job oppourtunities so adds her details to the company contacts in the top right hand corner. This very nicely comes up with an in place form for Sally to fill out.
    She fills out her details and is pleased when her contact card appears at the top but just incase she wanted to move herself below anyone else she notices the useful tooltip that tells her contact cards are draggable.

    \caption{Tooltip for company contacts}
    \end{figure}
    Students viewing company pages can then email any of the contacts since they must disclose their email addresses.

  \paragraph{Events and Placements:}
    Sally decides that it might be a good idea to post that Netcraft is offering six month industrial placements and so clicks on the new placement button. 
    She receives important notices from the departments she's registered to that she reads and makes note of and then procedes to create the placement.
    Similarly she can do the exact same thing with events.

    Sally then decides to look at an event that Netcraft is already advertising, as the event is coming up very soon she has the option to email the students more useful information, like how to get to Netcraft from the train station.
    This email will only be sent to receipients that are actually attending the event and must receive approval by a department admin before it is actually sent.
  
  \paragraph{Students:}
    After creating placements and events Sally decides she wants to browse students to find exceptional candidates she can contact herself. She clicks on students on the navigation bar and is greeted by a list of students. Note that any students who have decided to blacklist Netcraft will never appear in this list, nor will deactivated students.
    Since she knows Netcraft will be recruiting for Perl developers, she specifically types Perl into the skills filter
    and filters the list down to the students who have it as a skill.

    She can then browse their profiles, which is a reduced version of the student view lacking the events and placement partial views since they are not relevant to her. Since Jack has listed Perl as a skill his profile appears on the list.

    Liking what she see's Sally can then choose to download Jack's CV to her computer or view it online with the preview icon button and after reading Jacks CV Sally then chooses to invite Jack to interview, by clicking on the contact student button. She then sends an email from her account to his address which he can reply to if he wants. 

  \paragraph{Emails:}
    Being a member of the Corporate Partnership Program also entitles Netcraft to be able to contact a departments students via email. Sally can create emails to inform students of exciting scholarships Netcraft are offering, or news about the company. The great thing about our email client is that it supports HTML, so company styles can be used when sending emails through our system. Many companies use HTML emails with rich content when emailing students at the moment, this will allow this practice to continue, and indeed encourages companies to spend more time making their emails look enticing.

    Once she has written and sent her emails she must wait for them to be approved by an admin (including those sent previously).

    We have chosen for emails to be approved by an admin to avoid companies being able to spam students and hope that the need for admin approval encourages them to write detailed informative emails that are of an appropriate content for students. If it is not deemed applicable enough the admin can send the email back to the company for modifying with the reason, or reject it all together.
